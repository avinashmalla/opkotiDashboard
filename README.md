There are 3 main scripts.
- op-koti-python.ipynb (python notebook): In this file I extract data from op-koti.fi. Data cleaning also involved. Final db is stored in a csv file.
- op-koti-r.ipynb (R notebook): I take the cleaned data from the python script's csv file and carry out further modifications and again store it in another csv file for dashboard
- app.R (Dashboard script): Playing around to visualise the data better. The dashboard has 2 tabs, Table and Graphs.
